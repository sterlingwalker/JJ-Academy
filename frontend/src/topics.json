    "text": "BJJ beginners usually want to focus on one thing: Takedowns. After all, takedowns are what most people picture when they think about BJJ or MMA. However, without a complete BJJ skillset, your opportunities to apply the submissions you learn will be limited. Therefore, in addition to escapes and defense, beginners should focus on mastering a few basic BJJ sweeps. Sweeps are beneficial for several reasons. For one, sweeps allow you to go from a neutral or poor position to a strong position. In addition, sweeps are great for self-defense, as they allow a light, small person to gain position on a heavy, large person. Without a good arsenal of sweeps, your BJJ game wonâ€™t be nearly as strong as it could be. In this article, we review the first 3 sweeps you should master in BJJ. <br />The Scissor Sweep is one of the first sweeps that white belts learn in BJJ. Although it is extremely effective and relatively simple, it can be tough to pull off in practice. This often leads white belts to abandon it completely and move on to other types of sweeps. This is a big mistake. Although the scissor sweep takes time to master, it is well worth practicing. When mastered, this sweep works at all belt levels, and it enables a student in the bottom guard position to put his or her opponent in an inferior position. ",
